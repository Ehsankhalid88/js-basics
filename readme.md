Answer6: Statically typed languages
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is. The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.
Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

Dynamically typed languages
A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time.
Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang.


Answer7: null is an assigned value. It means nothing.

undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
